# RedM Extended [RDX]
⚠️ **Project is still in development and should not be se used right now.**

redm_extended is a roleplay framework for RedM, original code is from es_extended based on FiveM. The to-go framework for creating an economy based roleplay server on RedM!

RDX was initially developed by Gizz back in 2017, later on developed and improved by ESX-Org and shutdown by kanersps by a DMCA takedown.
Because I still had the complete original repo, I decided to use that code for RedM instead of FiveM.
All credits go to ESX-Org for all the work they had in the original framework (es_extended).
